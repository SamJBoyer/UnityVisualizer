# UnityVisualizer
this is a tool for visualizing joint angle positions in unity. 

Things you should do
- If you're using this with the C# node (which you probably should be doing) you should place the unity project folder next to your YAML graph. Theres not real reason you have to do this, its just what I do. However, you will have to access the unity project directory often, so its useful to put it in a location that you don't think will change
- Also, you have to make sure the scene with the unity visualizer matches whatever the nickname of the module the make and build file are in.

  IN THE FUTURE I WILL MAKE IT EASIER TO USE, JUST BEAR WITH THE CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION AND REACH OUT TO ME FOR QUESTIONS sam.james.boyer@gmail.com
